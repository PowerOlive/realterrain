# lua-imlib2

Provides a mostly complete binding to the imlib2 image manipulation library.  
You will need this library installed in order to use lua-imlib2 (preferably a 
recent version). This release makes no effort to wrap the X11 related Imlib2 
functionality, but aims to support all other features. The API is fully 
[documented](http://asbradbury.org/projects/lua-imlib2/doc/). If you encounter 
any problems or have any suggestions (or patches) then please contact me.
